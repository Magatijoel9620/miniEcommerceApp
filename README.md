## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter project structure, with key custom directories organized for clarity:

## State Management

This project utilizes the **Provider** package (`provider`) for state management.

- **`Shop` Class (`lib/models/shop.dart`):** This class extends `ChangeNotifier`. It holds the list of available products and the user's current shopping cart.
- **`ChangeNotifierProvider`:** Used in `main.dart` to make an instance of the `Shop` class available to widgets down the tree.
- **`context.watch<Shop>()`:** Widgets that need to display or react to changes in the cart or product data use this to listen for notifications.
- **`context.read<Shop>()`:** Widgets that only need to call methods on the `Shop` class (like adding to cart) without rebuilding on data change use this.
- **`notifyListeners()`:** Called within the `Shop` class methods (e.g., `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`) to inform listening widgets to rebuild with the updated state.

## Key Packages Used

- **`provider`**: (Version: `^6.0.0` or latest) For reactive state management, making it easy to manage and share application state like the shopping cart.
- **`badges`**: (Version: `^3.1.2` or latest) Used to display a notification badge (item count) on the shopping cart icon in the app bar.
- **`flutter/material.dart`**: The core Flutter package providing Material Design widgets and utilities.
